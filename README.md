## ðŸ§  Overview

This project is an **update to a previous analysis**, improved with additional features and refined techniques. It analyzes historical automobile sales segmented by vehicle type (e.g., **Small family cars, Executive cars, Superminis, Sports**) in correlation with:
- **Average vehicle price**
- **GDP per capita**
- **Sales performance during economic recessions**

The aim is to identify which vehicle categories maintain demand and which are most impacted by economic downturns.
