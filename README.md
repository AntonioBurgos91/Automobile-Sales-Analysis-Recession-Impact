## 📊 Overview

- 📆 Data generated for 40+ years of monthly auto sales
- 🛻 Sales trends analyzed by vehicle type
- 📉 Visual exploration of the impact of recession periods
- 🧪 Techniques: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Synthetic data generation

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Recessions significantly affect the sales of certain vehicle types more than others
- Medium and large family cars show the highest drop during economic downturns
- Visualization helps uncover long-term trends that are otherwise hidden
